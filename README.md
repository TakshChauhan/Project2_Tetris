## 🎯 Overview ✨📝
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tetris game written in C++. It features:

- Real-time gameplay with keyboard controls.
- Progressive speed increase as the game progresses.
- High score tracking saved to a file.

## 🖥️ Requirements 🔧⚡
- 🪟 Windows OS (due to usage of Windows-specific headers like `<windows.h>` and `_kbhit()` for keyboard input).
- 🛠️ A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher (e.g., MinGW, MSVC).

# Data Structures Used 🗂

- *vector<vector<int>>*: Stores the game grid and individual Tetromino shapes.  
- *vector<vector<vector<int>>*: Holds predefined Tetromino shapes.  
- *Tetromino (Class)*: Represents a falling piece with its shape, position, and color.  
- *Game (Class)*: Manages game logic, user input, rendering, and score tracking. 

## Data Members:
- grid: 2D vector representing the game board.
- currentPiece: Stores the currently active Tetromino.
- score: Tracks the player's score.
- highScore: Stores the highest recorded score.
- speed: Controls the drop speed of Tetrominoes.
- isGameOver: Boolean flag to indicate the end of the game.

## 🏗️ How to Compile 🖱️💻
Use the following command to compile the game (assuming `g++` is installed):

```bash
g++ -o tetris tetris.cpp
```

## 🚀 How to Run 📂⚙️
Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./tetris
```

## 🎮 Game Controls 🕹️🔄
| Key      | Action                     |
|----------|----------------------------|
| `A` or Left Arrow | 🔙 Move piece left            |
| `D` or Right Arrow| 🔜 Move piece right           |
| `S` or Down Arrow | ⬇️ Move piece down faster     |
| `W` or Up Arrow   | 🔄 Rotate the piece           |
| `Space`           | ⬇️ Drop piece instantly       |
| `P`               | ⏸️ Pause/Unpause the game     |
| `R`               | 🔄 Restart the game           |
| `ESC`             | ❌ Quit the game              |


## 🌟 Key Features 🚀🎮  
- *Dynamic Speed Adjustment:*  
   - The drop speed of the tetrominoes increases by 10% after every 5 pieces placed, with a minimum speed cap of 50ms.  
- *High Score Tracking:*  
   - The highest score is saved in a file named highscore.txt and loaded at the start of the game.  
- *Game Rendering:*  
   - The game grid and pieces are rendered using simple console characters.  
   - The current score, high score, and drop speed are displayed after each update.  
- *Pause and Restart:*  
   - The game can be paused or restarted at any time using the respective keys.  
- *Color-Coded Tetrominoes:*  
   - Each tetromino has a unique color, making it easier to differentiate shapes on the grid.  
- *Collision Detection:*  
   - Prevents pieces from overlapping or moving outside the grid, ensuring a fair gameplay experience.  

## 📄 Files 🗂💽  
- tetris.cpp - The main C++ source code containing the game logic.  
- highscore.txt - A file that stores the highest score achieved.  

## 🧠 Code Highlights 💡🔍  
- *Tetromino Management:*  
   - Each tetromino is represented as a 2D vector.  
   - Pieces can be rotated and moved within the grid.  
- *Collision Detection:*  
   - Ensures that pieces don't overlap or go beyond the game boundaries.  
- *Game Grid:*  
   - Maintained as a 2D vector representing the current state of the board.  
- *Console Handling:*  
   - The console cursor is managed for smooth rendering using Windows API functions.  

## ⚠ Limitations ⛔🚧  
- Only works on Windows due to the usage of specific libraries.  
- Basic visual design due to console-based rendering.  

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements 🔮💡  
- Cross-platform support by replacing Windows-specific code.  
- Adding colors for different tetrominoes using ANSI escape codes.  
- Implementing more advanced graphics using libraries like SDL or SFML.  
- Adding sound effects and background music.  
- *Game Enhancements & Features*  
  - ✅ Ghost Piece: Show a faint preview of where the current piece will land.  
  - ✅ Hold Piece Feature: Allow players to swap the current piece with a "held" piece.  
  - ✅ Next Piece Preview (Multiple Pieces): Show the next 3-5 upcoming tetrominoes instead of just one.
